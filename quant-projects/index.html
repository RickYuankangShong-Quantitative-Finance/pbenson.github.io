      <h3>Michigan Quant Lab</h3>

      <p>We meet on Fridays, 9:10-11:00am, in CC Little, room 1505. The first hour is structured, and can include solving programming problems, practicing interview questions, or learning about risk management. The second hour is for working on problems of your choosing, and I am available to help.</p>

          <li>Warmup: Project Euler problems 46 and 47.</li>
          <li>What's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heap_(data_structure)">heap</a>?</li>
          <!-- <li>Given the order statistics of a sample of size 10, what are the quantiles associated with each statistic? In particular, the first, and the last? We discuss some approaches to this.</li> -->
          <li>Monte Carlo Simulation: <a href="https://github.com/pbenson/Quant-python">clone the latest code</a>. Calculating VaR at various quantiles shouldn't require re-sorting the PnL. We learn about lazy initialization. We apply the same thing to ES. Time permitting, we compute portfolio risk.</li>

          <li>We added the Market class. A market consists of the risk factors to be simulated, with weighted returns from a specified period. A simulation of the market is generated by taking the inner product of each risk factor's returns with a market
            noise vector. </li>

            This is a very nice coding exercise: not only do you learn/review heap data structures, but it is an excellent example of polymorphism via both composition and inheritance. We got the MinHeap up and running. Next week will write BaseHeap and
            MaxHeap, then MedianHeap.</li>

        <p>To prepare:
          <ol>
            <li>Install <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/">PyCharm Community Edition</a>. Weâ€™ll be doing some Python in an IDE that has better debugging support than Jupyter.</li>
            <li>Solve the BinaryTree problem from the <a href="https://pbenson.github.io/docs/quantTechnicalQuestions/quantTechnicalQuestions.pdf">technical interview book</a>. You may use C++ or Python or both.</li>
            <li>Do LeetCode problems 2 and 20 (some of you have already done #20).</li>
            <li>Be able to explain why the sum of IES is equal to ES.</li>
            <li>We discovered that our C++ code for Monte Carlo does not react gracefully to an invalid name for a MarketFactor ("APL" is unknown). A better way to deal with this is through <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8480640/how-to-throw-a-c-exception">exceptions</a>.
              <script type="syntaxhighlighter" class="brush: cpp">
                <![CDATA[
void PortfolioSimResult::validateQuantile(double quantile) const {
   if(quantile < 1.0 / (m_profits.size() + 1) ) {
     throw "in PortfolioSimResult::validateQuantile(), quantile too small....";
   }
   ... }
 ]]>
              </script>

              Note that we threw a string. Which of these <a href="http://stdcxx.apache.org/doc/stdlibref/2-3.html">standard exceptions</a> would have been better to throw? Can you add exception handling to these PortfolioSimResult methods? double var(double
              quantile) const; double expectedShortfall(double quantile) const; If you do this problem, do a pull request from GitHub Desktop. If I like your code, I will add it to the codebase, and list you as a contributor!.</li>
            <li>Recall the Jane Street min max correlation problem? An equivalent statement is problem 2.7 in the technical interview book. Try to solve it.</li>

            <li>The mission of the <strong>Michigan Quant Lab</strong> is to prepare ourselves for employment through practice, and by demonstrating we are involved in something beyond the classroom. Think about the role(s) that need to be handled in the
              Michigan Quant Lab. Do you want to be developing the website? Implementing pricing algorithms? Building the backtesting framework? Writing a paper that explains and documents parts of our codebase? Creating test cases to verify our algorithms
              are working correctly? Organizing a Friday afternoon pizza-fueled meeting? Or something else?</li>

      <h3>Projects</h3>
      <p>Students in the quant program have the opportunity to develop projects inspired by real-world applications. This involves reading research, designing solutions, and implementing them in a relevant development environment, such as <a href="../cpp/index.html">C++</a>        or <a href="../python/index.html">Python</a>. </p>

        </ul>
      </p>

      <!-- <p>The steps involved can be summarized as:
                <ol>
                    <li>Determine which market factors (e.g. prices, exchange rates, interest rates, implied volatilities, etc) drive portfolio value.</li>
                    <li>Find market factor level data (typically daily close). To start, can use <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/history?period1=1412136000&period2=1475208000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d">Yahoo Finance</a>. Define a file format, which might look something like <a href="data/IBM_T_NKE_AAPL_20141001-20160930.csv">this</a>. Note that the example file uses YYYYMMDD format, which you can generate in Excel via a custom date format. You may need to  <a href="../cpp/finding-datafile.html">configure your directory path</a> so that your code can find  your data file.</li>
                    <li>Create a C++ data model for market factor data. For example, you might have a <code>Market</code> class, consisting of a map of named <code>MarketFactor</code> objects. </li>
                    <li>Read your CSV market data <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~eecs381/handouts/filestreams.pdf">from a stream</a> and populate MarketFactor objects that are added to <code>Market</code>. Since log returns never change, these could be computed and stored as well while you load prices into your <code>MarketFactor</code>. You can also capture the associated dates, taking advantage of the <a href="http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_62_0/doc/html/date_time/examples.html#date_time.examples.dates_as_strings">boost date_time library</a>.</li>
                    <li>You should be able to retrieve a <code>MarketFactor</code> from the <code>Market</code> object by name, using a <code>std::map</code>.</li>
                    <li>Create a scenario generating object (e.g. <code>MarketSimulation</code>). You shoud be able to ask a <code>MarketFactor</code> object for its return given the <code>MarketSimulation</code>. Now you have a working simulation of the market!</li>
                    <li>Now we need to see the PnL impact of the scenario on our portfolio. That means we can create a <code>Portfolio</code>, which contains <code>Position</code>s. Each <code>Position</code> is based on a some amount of a <code>Security</code>. Initially, we can assume our <code>Security</code> is a stock.</li>
