  The   final will be like the midterm with short answer questions.&nbsp; The test   will be open book, open web, open notes.&nbsp; To prepare for this, I   would recommend&nbsp; that you go over the midterm.&nbsp; I will have some questions similar to the midterm on the final. &nbsp;   In addition, make sure you thoroughly understand the following concepts:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Threads</li>
  <li>Networking</li>
  <li>Data Structures</li>
</ul>
<p>If you take the test in the testing center you will not have a time limit.&nbsp; <br>
  **********<br>
  If   you can't take the test in the testing center then you can take the   test online and you will be subject to a 4 hour time limit for this test.&nbsp;   The test will not shut off after 4 hours, but I will know how long you   took.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An email will be sent out to give you the dates for the test availability.</p>
