<h3>On Campus Group Study</h3>

<p>Many students have found <a href="https://sites.google.com/wccnet.edu/groupstudy/programming?authuser=0">Group Study</a> sessions helpful.</p>

<p>It is open to all students and is an opportunity to work with other students in a lab where a trained facilitator is there to answer questions. The trained facilitator is often a student who has taken and succeeded in the key computer classes at WCC. Group study is a way to build peer networks with fellow students at WCC.</p>

<p>It would be good to bring earbuds/headphones if you want to watch videos in a Group Study Session.</p>


<h3>Discussion Boards</h3>

<p>Each assignment will have a required class participation section associated with it. One way to participate for a given assignment is to post a question on one of the discussion boards. Another way to participate for a given assignment is to find a question to answer on the discussion board. Note that there are other class participation options, but the idea is to provide a social network for each class where we can have student-to-student interaction where you can help each other out.</p>

<p>The blackboard discussion board capability provides a capability where you can request an email sent to you when someone responds to your question.</p>

<p>It is not a good idea to post questions to the instructor on the discussion board. The discussion board is a good way to post a question to other students in the class.</p>


<h3>GoToMeeting</h3>
	<p>If the discussion board and study group still isn't answering your question, <a href="mailto:pbenson@wccnet.edu">send me an email</a> to setup a <a href="https://www.gotomeet.me/PeterBenson">GoToMeeting</a>.</p>

<!--

<h3>e-mail</h3>
	<p>It's usually tough to solve problems in an email. However, if none of the above options works for you, you can <a href="mailto:pbenson@wccnet.edu">send me an email</a>. If the question is precise enough and I have enough information, I can answer it. Otherwise, I may recommend that it is better to create an impromptu goto meeting to solve the problem.
