      <h1>How to get a good Grade</h1>
<ol>
  <li>There 1000 points on all of the Java Homework (JH) assignments + Tests ... <span class="highlightedBkgYellow">turn them in on time</span></li>
  <li><span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Watch ALL</span> of the required videos(<span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Actively</span>) before doing the assignments/Tests. Instead of watching the videos passively (like a TV show), engage your brain while watching the video. You can do this by taking notes. You can also do this by doing the program at the same time in Eclipse that is being created in the video. </li>
  <li><span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Practice</span> is essential to learning Java ... this is the purpose of the JH assignments.  The concepts are unlikely to click if you don't practice the concepts covered. </li>
  <li>If you are struggling with the JH assignments , you can get help:  See the Blackboard section on <span class="highlightedBkgYellow">&quot;Getting Help&quot;</span> for the available options</li>
  <li>Some of you have enough <span class="highlighted">discipline</span> to stay on track and will find that doing the <span class="highlighted">JH assignments</span> will be <span class="highlighted">sufficient</span> to mastering the material. </li>
  <li>Many of you would <span class="highlighted">benefit attending MM sessions</span>. As it was mentioned in the class policy video, this will help you avoid procrastination by getting help on a timely basis. Although Clem offered the MM_Bribe System mentioned in the video, I do not. Learning the material and improving your performance is ample reward for attending MM sessions.</li>
</ol>
<!-- <h1>MM_Bribe System</h1>
<h1>How does this affect your Effective Grade?</h1>
<p><span class="highlightedBkgYellow">MM_Attendance_Percentage(MAP)</span> = Percentage of the time that you showed up to MM sections (starting on the second week)</p>
<p>There are 1000 points on all of the <span class="highlightedBkgYellow">JH assignments + Tests</span>. </p>
<p>Let <span class="highlightedBkgYellow">G</span> = your score on JH assignments + Tests</p>
<p>Your<span class="highlightedBkgYellow"> Effective Grade</span> for the class (<span class="highlightedBkgYellow">EG</span>) will be:</p>
<h2>EG = 300*MAP + G * (1 - 0.28 * MAP)</h2>
<p>The best way to explain this is to describe 3 scenarios:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you never show up to an MM section(MAP=0) and you never do any practice problems and achieve a grade of G, then your effective grade will be G. </li>
  <li>If you show up to every MM section, it should improve your performance. Additionally, your Effective Grade will be  100% on 30% of your grade. The remaining 70% of your grade will be a little better than the percentage that you achieved (G) in JH assignments and tests. </li>
  <li>If you show up some of the time to MM sections  then your Effective grade wil be prorated based on how much you actually participated in the MM_Bribe_System. </li>
</ol>
