      <h1>Class Policy, Grades, Mechanics, etc.</h1>
      <p>This is based on Clem Hasselbach's original document.</p>
<h2>Goals of the Class:</h2>
<p>Learning to program is a lot like learning a foreign language (Spanish, German, etc.) or learning a musical instrument .... <span class="highlighted">Practice is required. </span>
</p><p>The assignments in this class are designed to provide the
necessary practice.  At times the assignments may seem challenging. The
goal of this class is that if you do well and complete these
assignments, you will end up having some valuable programming skills.
</p><p>It is important to <span class="highlighted">stay caught up</span> ... start the assignments early enough so that you can get help if you need it. <span class="highlighted">Don't skip lectures</span>, because each one has a purpose and in the end it may cost you some valuable information. </p>
<p>If you are having trouble understanding a concept or doing an assignment - <span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Get Help.</span>
  You will find out that there are many options for getting help in this
 class. One of the saddest things is when I know I have students who are
 struggling but for whatever reason they don't make use of the help that
 is provided. </p>
<h2>Class Mechanics to achieve the above class goals:  </h2>
<ol>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Blackboard</span> is your starting place for everything.  Buttons on the left provide you key course components.
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Announcements</span> - Regular
emails are sent out on your wccnet.edu student email account. You should
 find a way to stay tuned to this email address on a regular basis. Most
 of the emails (at least the important ones) are archived in the
"Announcements" section in blackboard. </li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Learning Units</span> - This link
gives you a step by step set of links to all of the course lectures.
Note that this web site "Expands" and "Contracts" by clicking on the
buttons at the top, or the "+"/"-" Icons on the left. Most of the
entries contain 2 Icons which provide the lecture (the video icon looks
like a video camera), and the text script that was used to produce the
lecture (left icon). </li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">JH...Homework files</span> - This
link takes you to a page containing all of the files that you need for
the JH1, JH2, ... JH7 homework assignments. This link was added after
the Class Policy was made so it isn't discussed in the video. It was
discovered to be a useful link. </li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Assignments &amp; Tests</span> -
This link takes you to all of the assignments and tests for this course.
 This will be discussed in more detail inside the startup folder under <span class="bold_italics_underline">assignments and tests</span>. </li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Discussion Board </span>-
Assignments come with required "Class Participation" requirements. Class
 Participation is done by posting entries on the discussion board. The
details of this process can be found in the Startup section under "<span class="bold_italics_underline">Discusson Board/Class Participation</span>". </li>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Getting Help</span> - If you are
needing help, especially on homework assignments, make sure you check
out the details on the options available to you for getting help.  For
details(times, rooms, office phone number, etc.) <span class="bold_italics_underline">click on the "Getting Help" button in blackboard</span>. The options include:
<ul>
          <li>Coming to <span class="bold_italics_underline">Office Hours</span>
            . You can also call me in my office during office hours. </li>
          <li><span class="bold_italics_underline">Mixed Mode(MM) class times</span> - you can attend these even if you are listed as a DL student or even a student in one of my other classes. </li>
          <li><span class="bold_italics_underline">Group Study time </span>- lab classroom with a trained facilitator</li>
          <li>Use <span class="bold_italics_underline">Class Participation question/answer discussion board</span> options for asking other students</li>
          <li>Use the<span class="bold_italics_underline"> "Questions for the Teacher" discussion board</span></li>
          <li><span class="bold_italics_underline">Go-to-meeting</span> -
            <ul>
              <li>Powerful tool for debugging problems remotely - We
have an electronic tool called "Go-to Meeting" which allows the teacher
to have an electronic meeting (voice and screen shared). </li>
              <li><span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Scheduling Goto Meeting</span> - The biggest challenge with this capability is scheduling the meeting.  The <span class="highlighted">easiest time is during office hours</span> because you can call my office phone to set it up. MM section times are also possible, but these need to be<span class="highlighted"> pre-arranged usually through an email request</span>.
 Send the email early enough to allow the instructor enough time to be
aware of it before the desired MM section meeting time. Other times may
be possible but are difficult to set up. </li>
              <li><span class="highlighted">"Go-to-Meeting" button</span> - The link for entering a meeting along with some tips on downloading and running the software</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><span class="bold_italics_underline">email</span> - Email
is NOT an effective way to provide debugging help when you are stuck on
an assignment...  the above mentioned options are much more effective
for getting debug help.  Email is an effective way to setup a "Goto
Meeting" time. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="highlighted">Go-to Meeting</span> - Provides the link for startup up Go-to Meeting.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Lectures</span> - All lectures are available as videos. They can be watched online. In Startup, there is a link called "<span class="bold_italics_underline">Video Features</span>"
 which attempts to highlight the characteristics of the videos. In most
cases, the video will be downloadable in a standard format such as MP4.
 Watch them actively (not like watching TV).  Two ways to watch the
videos actively are:
    <ul>
      <li>In most videos, a program is being worked on. <span class="bold_italics_underline">Try to do the same program</span>
 as the video progresses. You can pause the video to keep up. It is
helpful if you can play the video on another monitor or another
PC/tablet to free up your normal PC screen. </li>
      <li><span class="bold_italics_underline">Take notes on the lecture</span>.
  Although you can go back to the video at any point, it is productive
for our minds to be writing down summarized concepts covered as you
watch the video. You can also use your note taking as a way to get
credit for "class participation" ... see the Class
Participation/Discussion Board video for details. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Lecture Characteristics</span> - Because
 computer technology is always changing, the external web sites visited
may look a little different. Some of these videos were created on a
previous course that had a <span class="bold_italics_underline">slightly different environment or formats</span>.
 The navigational scheme has evolved and this does show up on some of
the videos.  In an attempt to make the videos more efficient for you, <span class="bold_italics_underline">some video deletions </span>have
 been made.  These deletions may show up as minor discontinuities. Many
of the deletions are related to Clem Hasselbach's  asthma and needing to
 clear his throat and eliminating filler words like Um, OK, etc. <br>
    <br>

<h2>Class Policy:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>I expect everyone to abide by the <a href="http://www.wccnet.edu/trustees/policies/4095/">WCC Students Rights and Responsibilities</a>
 which includes student conduct in the classroom and issues of cheating.
 Actions which negatively affect other students learning experience, or
actions of cheating will not be tolerated.
    I have been known to give a student a flunking grade for a class who
 was caught cheating.
  </li>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Cheating clarified</span> - I do
encourage student-student interaction through group study sessions and
requiring class participation on the discussion board, posting
questions, answers, etc. However, there is a difference between
answering questions and out right copying solutions from other students.
  Being caught on any cheating activity will result in a serious
penalty.  <br>
    <span class="bold_italics_underline"><br>
    Most of my tests are "open book" and "open web"</span>. The "open web" means that you can access the lecture notes and solutions provided in the course. However,<span class="highlightedBkgYellow"> "open web" does not imply other cheating mechanisms are allowed</span>. For example any of the following will be considered a violation of the cheating policy:
<ul>
      <li>posting a completed solution on a discussion board, or any other web site.</li>
      <li>copying a completed solution from a discussion board, or any other web site. </li>
      <li>When taking a test, DO NOT USE web resources such as Stack-Overflow or test banks to assist you in answering a test question. </li>
      <li>You will often be asked  for your code and some output from
your program.  If your program does not work, then in the output box say
 that your program doesn't work and try to describe the problem you had.
 Making up an output that your program didn't really create will be
considered cheating. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h2>Grades:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Grade Composition</span>
<ul>
      <li>60% - Homework
        - Note that each Homework assignment will include a class
participation component. Class Participation is done through posting
entries on a discussion board.
      </li>
      <li>40% - Tests - The nature of this component is discussed in each specific course. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Rubric</span> - Often at the top
assignments, a Rubric link will show up that describes characteristics
expected from your assignment. For example, the Rubric is likely to
request "properly indented code". </li>
  <li><span class="highlighted">Late Assignments</span>
<ul>
      <li>Submit your assignments before 11:59pm of the day the assignment is due. If it's not complete, turn it in anyway. </li>
      <!-- <li>First of all I want to state the obvious: <span class="bold_italics_underline">avoiding lateness is a matter of getting started early enough</span> to allow yourself to get help if you need it. </li>
      <li>25% deduction for assignments that are 1-6 days late</li>
      <li>40% deduction for assignments that are 7 days - 1 month late</li>
      <li>If an assignment is more than 1 month late, then it is too late to get credit for it.</li>
      <li><span class="highlightedBkgYellow">Extenuating Circumstances</span> - I often get lots of requests for extensions for <span class="bold_italics_underline">good</span> reasons.  My policy for these requests is as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>Turn in the assignment late with comments entered into the
 late assignment which document the good reason why you were late. The
normal lateness penalty will show up. </li>
          <li>Catch up and show a good track record for the rest of the course</li>
          <li>Stop by on the last day of classes (I will schedule times
when I am around) and we can look at how much the lateness deduction
cost you on your grade. If you have an overall <span class="bold_italics_underline">good track record especially at the end of the semester</span> and good reasons for being late I will be inclined to waive some of your lateness penalty deduction. </li>
        </ul>
      </li> -->
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li><span class="highlighted">Grading Scale</span> -
    The following is the default grading scale. At the end of the
semester, a more generous scale than this posted grading scale may be
considered.
    <ul>
      <li>93 - 100 ==&gt; A
      </li><li>90 - 92 ==&gt; A-<br>
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </li><li>88-89 ==&gt; B+
      </li><li>82 - 87 ==&gt; B
      </li><li>80 - 81 ==&gt; B-<br>
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </li><li>78-79 ==&gt; C+
      </li><li>72 - 77 ==&gt; C
      </li><li>70 - 71 ==&gt; C-<br>
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </li><li>68-69 ==&gt; D+
      </li><li>62 - 67 ==&gt; D
      </li><li>60 - 61 ==&gt; D-<br>
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      </li><li>&lt;= 59 ==&gt; E</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<hr>
<h3>MM versus DL sections:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>All of the material is available online for both the MM and the DL
 sections as described above.  In a DL section, there is no class room
time set aside for meeting with the instructor (note office hours are
always available for all).  For many students, this environment will
work fine.  In fact for some students the DL option is the only thing
possible because of life/work constraints.  Note that DL students can
attend MM sections if help is needed. </li>
  <li>However, some students need/prefer the opportunity to participate
in a more traditional class room setup.  So this is why  the MM(Mixed
Mode) sections are offered. Although there will be no traditional
lectures during these meeting times, the following benefits can be
obtained from a MM section:
    <ul>
      <li>If a student brings in "Ear buds", the lectures can be watched
 online and whenever something doesn't make sense, the video can be
paused and the student can ask the teacher present a specific question. </li>
      <li>If a student chooses to use the time to work on the
assignments, then when a point of confusion arises or some other problem
 presents itself the student can get prompt help from the teacher
present (or even another student) as opposed to waiting for an office
hour. </li>
      <li>By showing up at a regular time, a student is less likely to
procrastinate and put off watching videos until the last minute.
Remember that learning to program is a little like learning a music
instrument. Consistent practice pays off in music and in programming.
Putting off watching videos until an assignment is due is similar to
trying to practice 24 hours straight just before a concert. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
