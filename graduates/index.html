      <p>In September, 2015, 19 students began their studies in the University of Michigan's new <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/quantitative-finance.html">Quantitative Finance and Risk Management program</a>. This program is a successor to an earlier quant program at the U of M.

        <!-- <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/b/john-r-birge">John Birge</a>, at the time a professor in the University of Michigan's Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering department, created the U of M's Masters of Science in Financial -->
        The Industrial &amp; Operations Engineering department created the U of M's Masters of Science in Financial Engineering (MSFE) program, which admitted its first class in 1997. The MSFE program later moved to the Ross School of Business, and continued until 2014, when the last class graduated. The program had a similar mission to today's quant program, and it is worth studying what became of the earlier program's graduates.
      </p>

      <p>To study this, we gathered data via web search, especially LinkedIn, in June 2017. This captured employment information on almost 500 of the 700+ graduates of the MSFE program. The intention is to extend this data to include the new Masters in Quantitative Finance and Risk Management. It will be periodically updated. </p>

<h2>Employed graduates</h2>

      <p>Many of the graduates have post-graduate degrees, including PhDs, MBAs, JDs, even an MD. You can see a <a href="post-grad.html">summary here</a>. </p>

      <p>Students have been hired at over 300 different firms, with half of the jobs going to the top 30 employers. You can see the <a href="employers.html">complete list here</a>. These jobs are in <a href="cities.html">these cities</a>.</p>
<!--
      <p>The <a href="citizenship.html">citizenship</a> of our admitted students has shifted dramatically over the years, featuring a trend that has been continued by the current program. When the MSFE program ended in 2014, Chinese students made up 67% of the class. The new quant program has admitted 94%-100% Chinese students each year. <img src="CitizenshipByYear.png" /></a></p> -->
