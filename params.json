My current focus is on students in the [Quantitative Finance and Risk Management](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/graduates/quantitative-finance.html) program at the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n### QFRM boot camp\r\nIn the QFRM boot camp, you will develop your personal web presence with your [umich page](https://lsa.umich.edu/math/people/quantitative-finance-risk-management-students.html), your GitHub user page linked to GitHub projects (a page like this, but yours, not mine), and Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate your Python skills as they relate to finance.\r\n\r\nBootcamp requires that you have [Atom](https://atom.io), [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) installed.\r\n\r\nSee the Boot Camp project [here](qfrm-bootcamp).\r\n\r\n### Project Euler\r\n\r\nI've started using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) to practice writing efficient Python programs. I keep my solutions in a private repo out of respect for the Project's request that solutions not be published. Here's my progress so far:\r\n<img src=\"https://pbenson.github.io/images/project-euler-practice.png\"></img>\r\n\r\n### p5\r\n\r\n<script src=\"p5/libraries/p5.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"p5/libraries/p5.dom.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"p5/brownian/sketch.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n",
