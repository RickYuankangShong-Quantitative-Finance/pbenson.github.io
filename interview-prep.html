            <h2>Interview Preparation</h2>

            <p>Preparing for your interview is not like cramming for an exam. It takes much more time to adequately prepare for the variety of subjects you may be expected to know. Your coursework will help considerably, but you also need to develop your
                skills as a programmer, and expose yourself to the variety of question types that are apt to be asked in the technical interview.

                <h3>coding practice</h3>

                <p>There are now plenty of sites that allow you to learn and practice many languages. The most useful to the aspiring quant are Python, Java, C++.
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">HackerRank.com</a> has some of the best tutorials. When you solve a challenging problem, be sure to review how others did it. </li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.codility.com/">codility.com</a> is used to test candidates (e.g. the Chicago Trading Company)</li>
                            <li><a href="https://www.leetcode.com/">leetcode.com</a> is one of the practice sites favored by comp sci students</li>
                            <li>I use Google + <a href="http://stackexchange.com">stackexchange.com</a> all the time while coding, sometimes even if I already know how to do something. For example, what's the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/930397/getting-the-last-element-of-a-list-in-python">best way to access the last element in a Python list</a>?
                                You might already know how, but it's good to read how others do it. </li>
                        </ul>

                                        in distinguishing yourself as a quant.</li>
